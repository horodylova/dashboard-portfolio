## Client Testimonials
"I worked with Svitlana when we arranged the .Net conference Swetugg together. I've been organizing the conference for years, and when Svitlana joined she very naturally became one in the team. Since the start she has been contributing with great ideas, related to everything from social media and website functionality, to improving experiences for our visitors! She's been a joy to work with!"

— Sigge Sax, Developer and Swetugg Organizer

"One of Svitlana's standout achievements was creating a comprehensive training manual for new developers working on one of our projects. This manual became an integral part of our technical documentation. It provides detailed explanations on how to navigate the project, its structure, components, and management."
